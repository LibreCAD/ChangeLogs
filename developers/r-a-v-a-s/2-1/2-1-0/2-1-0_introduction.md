## Custom Toolbars

The Toolbar Creator (in the Widgets menu) offers a list of every tool (action)
in LibreCAD. You can create any amount of toolbars and edit them later.
Like all toolbars they can be dragged and dropped to where you want them.

There is also a new toolbar icon size option in Widget Options.

## Custom Menus

The Menu Creator is similar to the Toolbar Creator,
and allows you to assign a pop-up menu to  
Double-Click, Right-Click, Ctrl+Right-Click and Shift+Right-Click.

## Action History

If a custom menu has not been assigned,
Right-Click will invoke a list of recently used tools.

## Dock Areas

Dock widgets (e.g. command line or layer list) 
can be moved and docked at the top, bottom, left or right.
You can now show and hide all the dock widgets 
in a specific dock area. You can also toggle
the visibility of all floating dock widgets
(those which are not currently docked).

## Keycodes

In Application Preferences you can enable Keycode mode.
A command of two characters is considered a keycode,
and it will automatically trigger (i.e. you don't need to press Enter).

## Styles and Style Sheets

You can now dramatically change the way LibreCAD looks!

## More...

I recommend trying the new Spiderweb snap indicator
in combination with the "Hide cursor when snapping" option.

There is a fullscreen mode.

There is an anti-aliasing option.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, and only includes the highlights of my changes.
