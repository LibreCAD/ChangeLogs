# Double-click menu

You can create a menu that will appear when you double-click in the drawing area.  
Find: Widgets -> Create Double-click menu  
In that window you can double-click on items to add or remove them from lists.  
You can drag and drop the items to arrange them.  
Remove all items from the list to disable the menu.  
Note that a regular click is registered before the double-click;  
therefore, you will want to avoid double-clicking on an object.
